how to create one page with multiple forms
-dynamic submission of forms using FLaskWTForms?

solution: pass all the CLASS forms to the template for it to have all the structure of forms.
            create a script that will call the template / get the structure of the SELECTED FORM.

            The script will clear the current element that contains the form then appends the selected form.

            for submission, the controller must know which form has been selected through passing a value.
            this requires that every class form must include an ID that will be checked by the controller.
            after that the controller will check the validity of the forms according to the ID.

            to dynamically update the page use ajax request to server. the server will send back the updated list.
            or the server will only send back the last entry.
